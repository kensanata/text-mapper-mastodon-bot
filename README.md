How to:

Create a [Mastodon Bot](https://tinysubversions.com/notes/mastodon-bot/).
You need to save the three codes you got as follows:

The *Client ID* and *Client Secret* go into the first file, each on a
line of its own. The filename is `<account>.client`, for example
`textmapper@botsin.space.client`.

Example content:

```
1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
```

The *Access Token* goes to a separate file called `<account>.user`,
for example `textmapper@botsin.space.user`..

Example content:

```
7890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
```
